# AutoPark-Robot

 About the Code:  

This code is for an **auto-park robot** built with Arduino. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and parking spaces, servo motors to control steering, and a simple algorithm to autonomously park the robot.  

 Key Features:  
- "Obstacle detection" with ultrasonic sensors.  
- "Automatic movement" for precise parking.  
- "Angle-based control" for smooth entry into parking spaces.  

A great starting point for exploring "smart vehicle systems"!
